# Matt_Group_5_EUE_Project
The project aims to conduct a user-based usability evaluation of a shopping website *Metal Pressions*, and the team has tested the customisation feature of the website: its usability, clarity, and the quality of the user experience. The project is divided into a series of related tasks:
1. Preparation of a plan for a usability study, including demonstration of ethical study
2. Conduct the planned study and prepare a group report including recommendation based on findings
3. A five-minute video showing findings and recommendations

The site *Metal Pressions* includes a small application that allows users to customise their jewellery visually, and this will be an important target for our testing.

You can visit the initial Plan of the study from the document **"Matt_Group 5_Test Plan"** and the Final Report in **"Matt_Group 5_Report"**. All relavent materials are included in this study, including data gathering from users, consent form, ethnics report and details of the Screener Questionnaire.

The study is conducted from April 2022 to June 2022.
